# libft
Libft is a library of C functions that are often used in programming projects, created by 42 Seoul, a programming education institution. The library contains a wide range of functions, including string manipulation, memory management, and basic file input/output operations, as well as some additional functions that are commonly used in C programming.

The purpose of libft is to provide a set of standardized functions that can be used across different programming projects. By using these functions, programmers can save time and avoid repeating the same code over and over again. Additionally, since the functions are already tested and verified, they can be more reliable than custom-coded functions.

Libft includes functions such as:

String manipulation functions, including strlen, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strcmp, strncmp, strchr, strrchr, strstr, and more.
Memory management functions, including malloc, calloc, realloc, and free.
Linked list manipulation functions, including list creation, addition, deletion, sorting, and searching.
Additional functions for basic file input/output, character classification, and printing.
Libft also includes some bonus functions that are not part of the standard C library, such as ft_printf, which is a function for formatted printing, and get_next_line, which is a function for reading lines from a file descriptor.

Overall, libft is a useful library for C programmers, as it provides a comprehensive set of functions that can save time and improve the reliability of their code.
